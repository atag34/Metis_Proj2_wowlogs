# Metis Project 2

### Warcraftlogs and Linear Regression (Anthony Tagliente)

This project is focused on using data scraped from https://www.warcraftlogs.com/ to try and build a model
to predict how long it will take a group in WoW Classic to kill the raid boss Onyxia.

The project has specified that we should focus specifically on using linear regression for our modeling.

I have split the data scraping process into the data collection notebook, while the cleaning and analysis
is in the data analysis notebook. 

The final project PDF is also included here.

NOTE: Due to my own coding error, I mistakenly did not use the LASO model with polynomial features in my 
presentation. I had forgotten to take the exponential of the final product making it look like the model 
did not perform well. This is addressed in the codebook.
